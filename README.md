# Sentiment Analysis of Flight Reviews (ANN in Keras)

I decided to perform sentiment analysis of airline reviews in Keras for binary classification.

With this project, I wanted to simulate a situation where it is necessary to distinguish between positive and negative animal diagnostics to later train the model to predict the prognosis of the animals.
